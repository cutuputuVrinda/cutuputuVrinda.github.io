### Well Yes, Sometimes I may come across as a nerd, but I wanted to put in some genuine efforts to make you smile. I Love your Smile :))))).

I wanted to ask you out on a proper date, I dont mind texting and asking you directly, but I follow "‡§µ‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡•á‡§Ç‡•§" 

So Vrinda Ji, will you do me the honors ?

<!-- ### Closure and a Hint of Mystery üîí
As this readme file comes to an end, remember that life's too short not to indulge in a bit of playful banter. Stay awesome, Vrinda! 

### Banter üí¨
Just like well-structured code, you've got that perfect syntax of charm. üòâ
Shit yar, sachai dik gayi.
Alright, let's get down to business. This is a practice test, not a secret message (or is it?) 
### Gentle Reminders
Just a quick note to brighten your day. Remember, assignments are like passing clouds‚Äîhere today, gone tomorrow. Don't stress too much; you're as awesome as they come!-->
